*********************** Thanks for trying CDBFILE.ZIP! **********************
                        ##############################


    CDBFILE 1.0 is a C++ toolbox for programmers who wish to build soft-
    ware that manipulates dBASE III "*.DBF" files. It provides program-
    mers with a structured object-oriented interface to DBF files.
    It is licensed under the GNU public license.
    I hope that this work will be developed further on by other programmers.



    Here is the list of the files that should be in the package :

    CDBFILE.H           The C++ header file of the toolbox.
    CDBFILE.CPP         The complete source of the toolbox.
    CDBFILE.PS          A beautiful LaTeX-generated Postscript file
                        containing a manual for that set of tools.
    CDBFILE.TXT         An ugly ASCII version of the manual (for those who
                        don't have Ghostscript or a PS printer).
    COPYING.TXT         The GNU Public License for programs, which applies
			to TestDBF.CPP and TestDBF.EXE (text file).
    COPYING2.TXT        The GNU Public License for libraries, which applies
			to CDBFile.CPP and CDBFile.H (text file).
    README.TXT          You're reading it.
    TESTDBF.EXE         A Win32 console (user-unfriendly) demo of the tools.
    TESTDBF.CPP         The source of that demo.
